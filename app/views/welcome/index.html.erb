            <h5>I am a web developer living in the San Francisco Bay Area experienced using JavaScript and Ruby languages to plan, create, and implement functional and clean full stack applications.</h5>

            <p>I have always sought out opportunities and challenges that are meaningful to me. Although my professional path has taken many turns, I have never stopped engaging my passion to help others, to learn more, and to solve problems. The skills and accomplishments I have earned in my prior experiences have allowed me to become a stronger and well rounded developer. I am excited to make a big impact at a dynamic company with a team that shares the same passion and vision for positive change, collaboration, and growth.
            </p>

            <p>Aside from sitting in front of the computer all day, I enjoy discovering delicious foods, traveling to different places, and learning about other cultures. A great day would consist of happy hour and a nice brew with my close family and friends.... I will probably be the small girl in the back of the bar yelling at the TV during a Golden State Warriors game. </p>

          </p> I enjoy developing in all aspects of web: From front end engineering (HTML, CSS, jQuery, and JavaScript) to back end  (Ruby on Rails, Node.js, SQL). In addition, I have a strong background in data analysis and visual design chops from previous branding and marketing experiences.

            <h5 class="center"> <b> Collaboration & Planning </b> </h5>
            <p> Collaboration and communication are key to understanding a client's personal preferences for their project. I create wireframes layouts by hand or on Adobe Photoshop - focusing on the client's user story and vision. </p>

          <h5 class="center"> <b> Clean & Responsive Design </b> </h5>
        </p> I believe in responsive and clean design layouts that provide simple and intuitive interface and navigation. I am a minimalist who believes that less is more.
